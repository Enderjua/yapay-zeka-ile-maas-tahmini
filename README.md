# Predicting with AI

A simple artificial intelligence that predicts the salary based on experience using the experience and salary information at hand. This is the "Hello World" part of the job. More to come, stay tuned

# Requirements

You need to have Python installed on your computer
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

# Setup

**[1]** Install other required Python packages:
```
pip install numpy
pip install sckit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```

**[2]** Clone this repository and switch to its directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/Enderjua/yapay-zeka-ile-maas-tahmini
cd yapay-zeka-ile-maas-tahmini
```

**[3]** Put CSV Dataset
```
cd yapay-zeka-ile-maas-tahmini
```
Put your CSV file and Change code:
```
veri = 'your_csv_file.csv'
```

# Technologies used in the project

These tools have been helpful to us:

 * PYTHON3
 * SCKIT-LEARN
 * MATPLOTLIB
 * NUMPY
 * PANDAS
 * LİNEARREGRESSION

Some examples: 
```
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
yhead = lr.predict(xtest)
```
We are now implementing machine learning to start the prediction.
